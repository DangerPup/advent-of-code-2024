**Advent of Code 2024 Day 7**

Programming Language: Python

*Notes:*
- For part 1, I matched the example using hard-coding, but this will not work for the input...too much hard-coding. I could use ChatGPT to help generate all of the possible permuations, but want to avoid that for now (aoc-2024-07-p1-v1.py)
- I ended up going to ChatGPT to help explain why the Python itertool.Permutation() function was not working as expected.
- After describing the behavior I needed, ChatGPT recommended using the itertool.Product() function instead. (aoc-2024-07-p1-v2.py)

*Puzzle answers for my puzzle input:*
