**Advent of Code 2024 Day 3**

Programming Language: Python

*Notes:*
- Regular expressions! 
- I learned about "must be preceeded by" and "must preceed", which helped in part 1 to find the operands much quicker, no messy string manipulation stuff.
- In part 2, I had trouble with a bad placement of the `do` variable :confounded:
- Tested part 2 with both a match list and match iterater, either way works. The iterator is a little cleaner and you don't need to worry about incrementing the loop counter.
- I need to learn more about opening and reading the files, either to smush all lines together or have them already converted from binary to string.
