**Advent of Code 2024 Day 5**

Programming Language: Python

*Notes:*
- Puzzles are getting more challenging, these
- I managed to solve both parts of the puzzle, but the performance of the solution for part 2 is abysmal. I have something wrong with the recursion, there is excess. 
- I'll need to come back to this one...
- Revisited some of Python's unexpected rounding of floats.

*Puzzle answers for my puzzle input:*
1. 4637
2. 6370
